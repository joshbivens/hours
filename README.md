# hours
An open hours list for a business with JavaScript providing an "open" or "closed" text in the corner.

When hovered, the "Open/Closed" text will display a tooltip with hour many hours remain till open or close respectively.

I don't think I'm happy with it *just* being a tooltip, so I'll have to work on it some more.
